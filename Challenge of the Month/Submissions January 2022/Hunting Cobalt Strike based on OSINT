Hunting Cobalt Strike based on OSINT

The high fidelity Cobalt Strike IPs are collected and all lists are automatically retrieved and parsed on a daily (24h) basis and the final result is pushed to this repository.You can hunt for any Cobalt strike IPs in your environment with the query below.

Query

let MaliciousIPs = materialize (
    (externaldata(report:string)
    [@"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drb-ra/C2IntelFeeds/master/feeds/IPC2s.csv"]
    with (format = "txt",ignoreFirstRecord=true))
    | extend report = parse_csv(report)
    | extend RemoteIP = tostring(report[0])
    | project RemoteIP);
union
(MaliciousIPs
| join (DeviceNetworkEvents) on RemoteIP)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIP,InitiatingProcessAccountUpn,InitiatingProcessCommandLine,InitiatingProcessFileName
